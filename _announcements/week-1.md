On behalf of the entire [instructional team](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2023/staff) (all 2 instructors and 11 TAs), welcome to the Fall 2023 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2023/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/152706) contains your gradebook as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for discussion), instructions for submitting assignments and replicates much of the material on the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the [calendars for each section](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2023/calendar/), the first two lectures, and tutorials on installing your IDE, Typescript, and unit testing with Jest. The schedule of office hours and instructions for the first individual project deliverable will be posted at the start of the semester. 

We are excited to meet you all next week!
