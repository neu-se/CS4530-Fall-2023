We have published [instructions](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2023/activities/continuous-development) to help you create github repositories for your projects. Once you create your repos, you will also get access to the starter code for the project. Instructions will also guide you to set up CI/CD Pipeline for your projects. This is now assigned as Module 14 Activity on Canvas. 

Midterm exam is scheduled for the second half of next Week (i.e., on Nov 1-3, depending on when your class meets). For all in-person sections, all students are expected to be present in the classroom to complete the exam. For the online section, exam will also be given during the regular class time. Please contact your instructor {by email} immdediately if you need any accommodation.  

As part of the exam review, we have provided some resources on Canvas (under "Notes and Videos" page accessible through Modules link). Please be sure to review those!
