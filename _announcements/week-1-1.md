The first [individual project deliverable](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2023/assignments/ip1) is now available. This deliverable is due by September 20th at 11am ET. Your work will be submitted on Autograder.io which can be accessed through neu.autograder.io. Please note the autograding script will impose a strict rate limit of 5 submissions per 24 hours. This limit exists to encourage you to start early on this assignment. Feel free to use piazza to ask questions and use office hours if you need help. We have 55 hours of scheduled TA office hours per week starting tomorrow.
