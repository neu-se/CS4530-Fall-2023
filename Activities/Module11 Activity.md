# Test Adequacy Activity
We will gain experience improving test suites using two adequacy criteria: line coverage and mutation coverage. The instructions reference line numbers in transcriptManager.ts. Do *not* change that file while you are following along, or else you may find that the line referenced do not match what you see.

As usual, download the [starter code]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Activities/module11-test-adequacy.zip %}) and run `npm install`.

Then, follow the instructions given in the README.md file
