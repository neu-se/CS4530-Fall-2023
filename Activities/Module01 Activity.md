Before you start, be sure to review the tutorial [User Stories and Conditions of Satisfaction]({{site.baseurl}}{% link tutorials/week1-user-stories.md %}) on the course website.

### Scenario

Imagine that Southwest Airlines is your client and you are the lead of the development team.  You have already walked your client through the material in the tutorial, and together you have developed the following user story:

* As a resident of the State of Massachusetts, I would like to request my mail-in ballot so that I can cast my vote.

### Requirements for this activity

1. Write down at least 3 questions that you should ask the client before beginning to write conditions of satisfaction for this user story.
2. Write at least 3 conditions of satisfaction with appropriate priority
3. Then write 3 bad examples, and briefly say why they are bad.

When you are done, submit your work as required by your instructor.  This may vary from section to section.
