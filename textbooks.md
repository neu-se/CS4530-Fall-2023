## Textbooks

This class is a survey of many sub-areas of software engineering, and an unfortunate result of this is that there is no single textbook that is appropriate for this class. However, there are several texts that have chapters that are quite relevant, and most of these books are available for free for Northeastern students through O'Reilly's Safari Books online. To create your account, first visit this page: <https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/temporary-access/> and then select "Not Listed?

After this first account creation, you'll be able to log in directly to Safari Books Online with your @northeastern.edu email and no need for 2FA (hooray!). The schedule will list which chapters of which texts are relevant for each lecture:
