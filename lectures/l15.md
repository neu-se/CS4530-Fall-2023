### Learning Objectives:

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
* Define key terms relating to software/system security
* Describe some of the tradeoffs between security and other requirements in software engineering
* Explain 4 common vulnerabilities in web applications and similar software systems, and describe some common mitigations for each of them.
* Explain why software alone isn’t enough to assure security
