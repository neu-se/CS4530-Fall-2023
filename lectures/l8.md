### Learning Objectives:
Building on Module 7, we will have a deeper discussion of common patterns of programming with React. By the end of this module you should be able to:

* Explain the basic uses of `useEffect`
* Explain when a `useEffect` is executed, and when its return value is executed
* Construct simple custom hooks and explain why they are useful
* Be able to map the three core steps of a test (assemble, act, assess) to UI component testing.
