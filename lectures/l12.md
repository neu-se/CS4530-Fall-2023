### Learning Objectives:

Modules larger than a single function or class introduce new difficulties in testing.  In this module, you will learn:
* When and why you might introduce a test double in your testing
* How and when to apply different kinds of test doubles such as mocks and spies
* Why a system might require tests larger than unit tests.
