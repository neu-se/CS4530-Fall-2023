# Specifications for Fall 2023 Live Presentations (Sec 6, Prof. Wand)

Each group will present a live demo for the final project. You can imagine this as the live presentation that you would make if you were standing in front of your poster at a conference. Imagine your target audience as a recruiter for a software engineering role: your goal is to demonstrate that you have some experience working on some non-trivial software engineering project. 

We expect all students to attend the entire set of presentations. We *will* be taking attendance (via zoom logs). 

You will have 10 minutes maximum (9 minutes to setup and present. 1 minute for questions and everything else). You will lose points if your demo goes over 9 minutes. Please rehearse it and time yourself (best to keep it to 8 minutes)! 

Your presentation may be a combination of narrated slides and live demonstration. Your slides may reuse materials from your poster. The live demonstration must be run on the hosted site, rather than on your local machine.

Your presentation should include the following:
* A description of the feature you added
* A live demonstration of your project, including all of the screenshots from your poster.
* A summary of the technology stack and overall design decisions (this may also be taken from your poster)
* Short summary of overall contribution by each member 
* A summary of challenges were faced and how you overcame them (alternatively, how the project you delivered differed from the one you proposed).

You should submit a copy of your pptx or pdf of your slides on Canvas.

## Grading Rubric:
Each of the elements above will be graded separately, with the following point value:
* A description of the feature you added (1pt)
* A live demonstration of your project, including all of the screenshots from your poster. (5 pts)
* A summary of the technology stack and overall design decisions (2 pts)
* Short summary of overall contribution by each member (1 pt)
* A summary of challenges were faced and how you overcame them (alternatively, how the project you delivered differed from the one you proposed). (1 pt)
