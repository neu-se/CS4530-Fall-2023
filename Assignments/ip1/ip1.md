# Individual Project (Deliverable) 1 
**PLACEHOLDER FROM SPRING 2023**{: .label .label-yellow }

Welcome to the Covey.Town team! 
We're glad you're ready to join our development team as a software engineer. 
We're building an open source virtual meeting app, and are happy to see so many new developers who can help make it a reality. 
By semester's end, you'll be able to propose, design, implement and test a new feature for us.
We understand that most of you have limited web development experience, hence, we created a project to help you get up to speed with our codebase and development environment.

Covey.Town is a web app that runs in each client's web browser and also has server. 
Players join the app in a *town*: a 2D arcade-style map with different rooms.
Each town is also a video call, where players near each other can see/hear each other; a text chat is  globally available in town. 
The town has several types of *areas*" that provide interactive functionality for players within their borders. 
The `InteractableArea` is an abstraction that represents the shared functionality for interactive areas. 
Last term, we worked on adding a concept called [Viewing Areas](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2022/assignments/ip2), allowing players to have "watch parties".
Many student projects (some are [showcased](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2022/assignments/project-showcase)) involved creating other kinds of flexible interactions such as game areas for several different multi-player games, and file sharing, among others.

This semester, we'll add a new kind of area: a `PosterSessionArea`, which allows players to upload the image of a poster, and for others in the area to discuss that poster in a dedicated chat channel and to *star*" a poster (like stars on GitHub).

Previously, there was a single chat for the entire Town: this term, players will implement a chat for the area they are in -- this means that messages between players in the same area are visible to each other, but not to players outside this area. 
This is implemented as a modification of the `ChatMessage` type to include information about what area it originated from, and inclusion of this information when sending messages from within an area.

The goals for our project are to modify the `ChatMessage` to include area-specific Id and to implement the .`PosterSessionArea`.  This effort will be split across two deliverables. 
In our first deliverable, you will implement and test the backend components for the new `PosterSessionArea`, and in the next deliverable, you will connect these components to the rest of the backend, and implement the frontend components. 

## Objectives

* Learn the basics of VSCode, and our codebase
* Learn how to read and write code in TypeScript
* Translate high-level requirements into code
* Learn how to write unit tests with Jest

## Changelog
* 1/11/23: Updated UML diagram to include `PosterSessionArea` and `ChatMessage` classes
* 1/13/23: Divided the `TownsController.test.ts` tests into 2 files: `TownsController.test.ts` the old file now only has the integration tests for the non-poster-session-area components, and `PosterSessionController.test.ts` has the new tests for `createPosterSessionArea` and the other functions specified in Task 3. Students now need to extend `PosterSessionController.test.ts` with their own tests, and don't need to submit `TownsController.test.ts` (the reason for this split: fixing timeout errors on the test suite) 

## Getting started 

Download the [starter code]({{site.baseurl}}{%link /Assignments/ip1/ip1-handout.zip %}), extract the archive, and run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies. 
We have some basic sanity tests that you will extend.

## Overview of relevant classes

This UML class diagram shows the `PosterSessionArea` and `ChatMessage` classes you will implement, along with  extracts from relevant classes that you will interact with.

## Grading

You will be scored out of 100 points, 90 of which are automatically awarded by the grading script, the remaining 10 are manually awarded.

Your code will be evaluated for linter errors and warnings. Submissions that have *any* linter errors will automatically receive a grade of 0. **Do not wait to run the linter until the last minute**. To check for linter errors, run the command `npm run lint` from the terminal. The handout contains the eslint configuration used by our grading script.

Your code will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a test suite that expands on the core tests that are distributed in the handout. 

Your tests will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a process that will inject bugs into our reference solution: to receive full marks your tests must detect a minimum number of injected bugs. 

You will __not__ receive detailed feedback on which injected bugs you do or do not find, and you will __not__ receive detailed feedback on which tests you do or do not pass.

The autograding script will impose a strict rate limit of 5 submissions per 24 hours.
Submissions that fail to grade will not count against the quota.
This limit exists to encourage you to start early on this assignment: from experience this assignment should take between 3-15 hours.

If you start early, you will be able to take full advantage of the resources that we provide to help you succeed: office hours, Piazza and a greater total number of submission attempts.

Your code will be manually evaluated for conformance to our course [style guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link style.md %}) (10 points):
* Names (e.g. local variables, methods, etc.) follow our naming conventions
* No unused variables
* Public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) are documented with JSDoc-style comments
* No duplicated code that could have been refactored into a shared method.

We will deduct two points for each violation.

## Implementation Tasks

This deliverable has four parts.  Complete the work one part at a time, in order.

### Task 1: Extend chat messages (10 points total)

The `ChatMessage` type represents the information passed along with the message contents when a `Player` sends a message.
To enable area-specific chats, we are adding the identifier of the `InteractableArea` as an `interactableId` field to the `ChatMessage` (or `undefined` if the `Player` is not in an `InteractableArea`). 
The server should forward messages only if the `interactableId` of the message is the same as that of player's location. 

To demonstrate your understanding, add tests to `Town.test.ts`. As an example, weâ€™ve included the test `'Forwards chat messages to players with the same ID as the message ID'`. 

Grading:
* modify server to send messages to clients with the same `interactableId` as the player/message (3 points).
* message-passing test in `Town` should run, once the new field is added (2 points)
* add new tests for `InteractableArea` to `Town.test.ts` (5 points)

### Task 2: Add the PosterSessionArea (40 points total)

The `PosterSessionArea` specializes `InteractableArea` to store three properties: poster (a string with the contents of the poster file to be viewed or undefined if none is set), stars (the number of stars that other players have given this poster, starting at 0), and title (a string with the title of the poster or undefined if no poster is set).

Like the other areas, the `PosterSessionArea` specializes the behavior of `remove`, in this case setting the poster image and title properties to `undefined`, stars to 0, and emitting this update to the players in the town when the last player leaves the `PosterSessionArea`.

The `PosterSessionArea`, like the `ViewingArea`, adds a new method, `updateModel`, used in the next deliverable to update the state while clients are interacting with the poster (e.g., starring it).

/**
 * Removes a player from this poster session area.
 * When the last player leaves, this method clears the poster 
 * and its title, resets stars, and emits to all players in the Town.
 * @param player to be removed
 */
public remove(player: Player): void;

/**
 * Updates the state of this instance, setting the poster, title, 
 * and stars properties
 * @param posterSessionArea updated model 
 */
public updateModel({ poster, title, stars}: PosterSessionAreaModel);

/**
 * Convert this instance to a simple PosterSessionAreaModel suitable 
 * for transporting over a socket to a client (i.e., serializable).
 */
public toModel(): PosterSessionAreaModel;

/**
 * Creates a new PosterSessionArea object in the town map.
 * @param mapObject a ITiledMapObject that is the rectangle in which this viewing 
 * area exists
 * @param townEmitter An emitter used to broadcast updates to players in the town
 */
public static fromMapObject(obj: ITiledMapObject, emitter: TownEmitter): PosterSessionArea;

{% endhighlight %}
</details>

Grading for implementation tasks: 20 points total
* add the correct fields/getters/setters to the class: 3 points
* implement `remove`: 5 points
* implement `updateModel`: 5 points
* implement `toModel`: 2 points
* implement `fromMapObject`: 5 points

Grading for testing tasks: 20 points total
* test `updateModel`: 5 points
* test `toModel`: 5 points
* test `fromMapObject`: 5 points
* test `remove`: 5 points

### Task 3: Add a REST API (30 points total)

We now turn to the public-facing web service APIs that the client can directly invoke.

These methods are located in two files:
* `src/town/Town.ts` (`socket.on('interactableUpdate')` handler and `addPosterSessionArea`)
* `src/town/TownsController.ts` (`createPosterSessionArea`, `incrementPosterAreaStars`, `getPosterAreaImageContents`)
The `socket.on` handler is automatically invoked by the socket-io library when an event is received from a remote client. 
The `createPosterSessionArea` function is automatically invoked by the tsoa REST middleware when a REST request is made by a remote client. For this deliverable, you will not need to write any code for the middleware and we will be discussing these in future lectures.

To run the tests for this part, run the command `npm test TestName`, where `TestName` is either `Town.test` or `PosterSessionController` (which runs the tests for the new functions in `TownsController`).

### Task 4: Add method createInteractablesFromMap (10 points total)

Your last task is to implement a function to validate the `InteractableArea`s defined in the town's map file and populate the `Town` with instances of `ViewingArea`, `ConversationArea`, and `PosterSessionArea` to represent those areas. Implement this function in the method `initializeFromMap` in `src/town/Town.ts`. 

We provided you with a test case for some of the basic functionality of this function. Add tests in the same `describe` block as the existing one in `src/town/Town.test.ts`. To run these tests, type `npx jest --watch Town.test`.

The function takes a `ITiledMap` object; you can learn more about the structure from reviewing the type definition, from the [Tiled JSON Map Format Specification](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/json-map-format/), and from the example provided in the test case for `initializeFromMap`. The specific *layer* of the map that you are looking for will be of the type `ITiledMapObjectLayer`. The object layer will list all of the objects. The `type` property of each object in that layer identifies it as a `ViewingArea`, `ConversationArea`, `PosterSessionArea` or other - you can ignore any others.

The grading script will run two integration tests as part of grading this task. The integration tests check every method that you were required to complete. These two tests are clearly identified as integration tests in the grading output. 
Do *not* try to replicate these integration tests in your tests for `initializeFromMap`. We will *only* grade your tests for `initializeFromMap` on their ability to find defects in our implementation of `initializeFromMap`, and *not* in any other functions.

Grading:
* correct implementation (6 points)
* tests (4 points)

Welcome aboard to the Covey.Town team! We're glad that you're here and ready to join our development team as a new software engineer.
We're building an open source virtual meeting application, and are very happy to see that we have so many new developers who can help make this application a reality.
By the end of the semester, you'll be able to propose, design, implement and test a new feature for our project.
We understand that some of you may have some web development experience, but don't expect that most of you do, and hence, have created an individual project to help you get up to speed with our existing codebase and development environment.

Covey.Town is a web application that consists of some code that runs in each client's web browser, and also code that runs on a server.
Users join the application in a "town": a 2D arcade-style map with different rooms to explore.
Each town is also a video call: when two players get close to each other, they can see and hear each other; there is also a text chat available within the town.
In Winter of 2021, our lead software engineer, Avery, developed a prototype for Covey.Town, and since then, hundreds of students in this class have built on that codebase.
The most recent class-wide effort added a concept called [Poster Areas](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2023/assignments/ip1), allowing players to upload a poster which is then dispalyed and discussed in a special part of the town.
Many student projects over the past few years (some of which are publicy showcased [from Spring 2022](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2022/assignments/project-showcase) and [from Fall 2022](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Fall-2022/assignments/project-showcase)) involved creating games within Covey.Town.
For example: students created implementations of soccer, blackjack, dance dance revolution and tic-tac-toe.

After studying all of the student projects and their implementation challenges, our lead software engineer, Avery, has refactored Covey.Town, designing a new abstraction to make it easier to create games like these. 
Avery's new abstraction, `GameArea`, is a region of the town that provides some core elements to allow players to play games within that area.
The abstraction cuts across the entire technology stack: `GameArea`s exist in the 2D map and the application automatically tracks when players enter and exit them.
By pressing the spacebar within an `GameArea`, the user can trigger an interaction with that area, which in turn can be easily used to display new content in the web app using React.
A `GameArea` in one user's browser can also emit events that are delivered in real-time to other players interacting with that same area.
The `GameArea` provides common functionalities that all games might want to provide: allowing players to join and observe a game, as well as tracking a leaderboard.

The objective for this semester's individual project is to implement this new `GameArea` abstraction, with one concrete implementation: `TicTacToeArea`. 
The `TicTacToeArea` will implement the gameplay for the classic game, [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).
This implementation effort will be split across two deliverables. In this first deliverable, you will implement and test the core backend components for this feature, and in the second deliverable, you will implement and test the frontend components. 

## Objectives of this assignment
The objectives of this assignment are to:
*  Get you familiar with the basics of TypeScript, VSCode, and the project codebase
*  Learn how to read and write code in TypeScript
*  Translate high-level requirements into code
*  Learn how to write unit tests with Jest

## Getting started with this assignment

Before you begin, be sure to check that you have NodeJS 18.x installed, along with VSCode. We have provided a [tutorial on setting up a development environment for this class]({{site.baseurl}}{% link tutorials/week1-getting-started.md %}) 
Start by [downloading the starter code]({{site.baseurl}}{% link /Assignments/ip1/ip1-handout.zip %}). Extract the archive and run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies. Avery has provided you with some very basic sanity tests that you can extend for testing your implementation as you go. You can run these tests with the command `npm test TicTacToe` (note that many tests are *expected* to fail until you have begun to implement the assignment).

## Grading
This submission will be scored out of 100 points, 90 of which will be automatically awarded by the grading script, with the remaining 10 manually awarded by the course staff.

Your code will automatically be evaluated for linter errors and warnings. Submissions that have *any* linter errors will automatically receive a grade of 0. **Do not wait to run the linter until the last minute**. To check for linter errors, run the command `npm run lint` from the terminal. The handout contains the same eslint configuration that is used by our grading script.

Your code will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a test suite that expands on the core tests that are distributed in the handout. 
Your tests will be automatically evaluated for functional correctness by a process that will inject bugs into our reference solution: to receive full marks your tests must detect a minimum number of injected bugs. 
Each submission will be graded against the same set of injected bugs (repeated submissions will not receive new/different injected bugs).
You will __not__ receive detailed feedback on which injected bugs you do or do not find.

The autograding script will impose a strict rate limit of 5 submissions per 24 hours.
Submissions that fail to grade will not count against the quota.
This limit exists to encourage you to start early on this assignment: students generally report that assignments like this take between 3-20 hours.
If you start early, you will be able to take full advantage of the resources that we provide to help you succeed: office hours, discussion on Piazza --- and the ability to have a greater total number of submission attempts.

Your code will be manually evaluated for conformance to our course [style guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link style.md %}). This manual evaluation will account for 10% of your total grade on this assignment. We will manually evaluate your code for style on the following rubric:

To receive all 10 points:
* All new names (e.g. for local variables, methods, and properties) follow the naming conventions defined in our style guide
* There are no unused local variables
* All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) are documented with JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does, as defined in our style guide
* The code and tests that you write generally follows the design principles discussed in week one. In particular, your design does not have duplicated code that could have been refactored into a shared method.

We will review your code and note each violation of this rubric. We will deduct two points for each violation, up to a maximum of deducting all 10 style points.

## Overview of Relevant Classes
The UML class diagram below shows the three main classes that you will be implementing for this deliverable (`TicTacToeGameArea` and `TicTacToeGame`) along with several relevant classes for additional context. An `InteractableArea` represents a region of the 2D map that the player can interact with - existing implementations of this interface include `ConversationArea` and `ViewingArea`.

The new `GameArea` abstraction extends `InteractableArea`, adding state to track the current `Game` in the area and the history of past games using its `GameResult` array. Subclasses of `GameArea` must implement the `handleCommand` method of `InteractableArea`, which is how messages are passed from clients to the server.

The base `Game` abstract class tracks the state of the game, including who is playing it. The abstract class includes the glue that allows the socket protocol to serialize the game state such that it can be sent from the server to clients. Implementors of the `Game` abstract class implement the methods `applyMove`, `_join` and `_leave`.

## Implementation Tasks
This deliverable has four parts; each part will be graded on its own rubric. You should complete the assignment one part at a time, in the order presented here.

**General Requirements**: Implement your code *only* in the files specified: `src/town/games/TicTacToeGame.ts`, `src/town/games/TicTacToeGame.test.ts` and `src/town/games/TicTacToeGameArea.ts`. You should not install any additional dependencies. The autograder will ignore any other files that you modify, and will not install any dependencies that you add to the project.

### Task 1: Joining and Leaving the TicTacToeGame (24 points)
The `TicTacToeGame` class extends the base `Game` class, implementing the semantics of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. Avery has provided a definition for the types that will be used to represent the state of a `TicTacToeGame` - `TicTacToeGameState`. That type definition is reproduced below:

{% highlight typescript %}
/**
 * Type for the state of a TicTacToe game
 * The state of the game is represented as a list of moves, and the playerIDs of the players (x and o)
 * The first player to join the game is x, the second is o
 */
export interface TicTacToeGameState {
  moves: ReadonlyArray<TicTacToeMove>;
  x?: PlayerID;
  o?: PlayerID;
  winner?: PlayerID;
  status: 'IN_PROGRESS' | 'WAITING_TO_START' | 'OVER';
}
/**
 * Type for a move in TicTacToe
 * The row and column are 0-indexed, so the top left square is (0,0) and the bottom right square is (2,2)
 */
export interface TicTacToeMove {
  gamePiece: 'X' | 'O';
  row: TicTacToeGridPosition;
  col: TicTacToeGridPosition;
}
export type TicTacToeGridPosition = 0 | 1 | 2;
{% endhighlight %}

As a gentle introduction to this abstraction, your first task is to implement the `_join` and `_leave` methods of `TicTacToeGame`. To implement these methods, you should not need to read any other parts of the codebase besides `Game.ts`.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<details><summary markdown="span">View the specification for these methods</summary>
{% highlight typescript %}
  /**
   * Adds a player to the game.
   * Updates the game's state to reflect the new player.
   * If the game is now full (has two players), updates the game's state to set the status to IN_PROGRESS.
   *
   * @param player The player to join the game
   * @throws InvalidParametersError if the player is already in the game (PLAYER_ALREADY_IN_GAME_MESSAGE)
   *  or the game is full (GAME_FULL_MESSAGE)
   */
  public _join(player: Player): void

 /**
  * Removes a player from the game.
  * Updates the game's state to reflect the player leaving.
  * If the game has two players in it at the time of call to this method,
  *   updates the game's status to OVER and sets the winner to the other player.
  * If the game does not yet have two players in it at the time of call to this method,
  *   updates the game's status to WAITING_TO_START.
  *
  * @param player The player to remove from the game
  * @throws InvalidParametersError if the player is not in the game (PLAYER_NOT_IN_GAME_MESSAGE)
  */
  protected _leave(player: Player): void
{% endhighlight %}
</details>

*Testing*: Avery has provided you with some very simple (and incomplete) tests for `_join` and `_leave`. You can run these tests by running the command `npx jest --watch TicTacToeGame.test`, which will automatically re-run the tests as you update the file (note that tests for `applyMove` will also run - but you can ignore those at this point). You should improve the `_join` and `_leave` tests to check the entire specification. Please implement these additional tests in the file `src/town/games/TicTacToeGame.test.ts`.

Grading for implementation tasks:
* `_join`: 6 points
* `_leave`: 6 points

Grading for testing tasks:
* `_join`:
  * 6 points for detecting all 25 faults, or
  * 3 points for detecting 24 faults
* `_leave`: 6 points 

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game Semantics (50 points total)
The next (and largest) task for this deliverable is to implement the method `TicTacToeGame.applyMove`, which applies a player's move to the game. This method is responsible for validating the move, and updating the game state to reflect the move. Given the complexity of this method, you should anticipate creating (at least one) private, helper method to implement its logic.

<details><summary markdown="span">View the specification for this method</summary>
{% highlight typescript %}
  /* 
   * Applies a player's move to the game.
   * Uses the player's ID to determine which game piece they are using (ignores move.gamePiece)
   * Validates the move before applying it. If the move is invalid, throws an InvalidParametersError with
   * the error message specified below.
   * A move is invalid if:
   *    - The move is on a space that is already occupied (use BOARD_POSITION_NOT_EMPTY_MESSAGE)
   *    - The move is not the player's turn (MOVE_NOT_YOUR_TURN_MESSAGE)
   *    - The game is not in progress (GAME_NOT_IN_PROGRESS_MESSAGE)
   *
   * If the move is valid, applies the move to the game and updates the game state.
   *
   * If the move ends the game, updates the game's state.
   * If the move results in a tie, updates the game's state to set the status to OVER and sets winner to undefined.
   * If the move results in a win, updates the game's state to set the status to OVER and sets the winner to the player who made the move.
   * A player wins if they have 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   *
   * @param move The move to apply to the game
   * @throws InvalidParametersError if the move is invalid
   */
  public applyMove(move: GameMove<TicTacToeMove>): void
{% endhighlight %}
</details>

Grading for implementation tasks:
* Applying moves: 8 points
* Checking for invalid moves: 9 points
* Handling game-ending moves: 11 points
  
Grading for testing tasks:
* Applying moves: 6 points
* Checking for invalid moves:
  * 7 points for detecting all 35 faults
  * 4 points for detecting 34 faults
* Handling game-ending moves: 9 points

### Task 3: Implement the TicTacToeGameArea (16 points total)
The `TicTacToeGameArea` receives `InteractbleCommand`s from players who enter the area on their client. The main responsibility of this class is to interpet those commands, dispatching them as appropriate to the `TicTacToeGame` instance that it manages. Your final task is to implement the `handleCommand` method of `TicTacToeGameArea`.

There are three types of commands that the `TicTacToeGameArea` will receive, which map directly to the three methods of `TicTacToeGame` that you implemented in the previous task. 

Avery has provided a complete test suite for `handleCommand` - you do not need to write any additional tests.

<details><summary markdown="span">View the specification for this methods</summary>
{% highlight typescript %}
   /**
   * Handle a command from a player in this game area.
   * Supported commands:
   * - JoinGame (joins the game `this._game`, or creates a new one if none is in progress)
   * - GameMove (applies a move to the game)
   * - LeaveGame (leaves the game)
   *
   * If the command ended the game, records the outcome in this._history
   * If the command is successful (does not throw an error), calls this._emitAreaChanged (necessary 
   *  to notify any listeners of a state update, including any change to history)
   * If the command is unsuccessful (throws an error), the error is propagated to the caller
   *
   * @see InteractableCommand
   *
   * @param command command to handle
   * @param player player making the request
   * @returns response to the command, @see InteractableCommandResponse
   * @throws InvalidParametersError if the command is not supported or is invalid. Invalid commands:
   *  - LeaveGame and GameMove: No game in progress (GAME_NOT_IN_PROGRESS_MESSAGE),
   *        or gameID does not match the game in progress (GAME_ID_MISSMATCH_MESSAGE)
   *  - Any command besides LeaveGame, GameMove and JoinGame: INVALID_COMMAND_MESSAGE
   */
  public handleCommand<CommandType extends InteractableCommand>(
    command: CommandType,
    player: Player,
  ): InteractableCommandReturnType<CommandType> 
{% endhighlight %}
</details>

Grading for implementation tasks:
* Handling JoinGame: 4 points
* Handling GameMove: 6 points
* Handling LeaveGame: 5 points
* Handling invalid commands: 1 point

## Submission Instructions
Submit your assignment to the instance of Autograder.io running at [neu.autograder.io](https://neu.autograder.io).
Navigate to [neu.autograder.io](https://neu.autograder.io) in your web browser, click the "Sign in" button, and log in with your Northeastern account.
You should then see the course listed on the neu.autograder.io home page.
Please contact the instructors immediately if you have difficulty accessing the course on Autograder.io.
If you haven't been added to the course roster yet, you can access the assignment page at [this direct link](https://neu.autograder.io/web/project/10).

To submit your assignment: run the command `npm run zip` in the top-level directory of the handout. This will produce a file called `covey-town-townService.zip`. Submit that zip file on Autograder.io.

Autograder.io will provide you with feedback on your submission, but note that it will *not* include any marks that will be assigned after we manually grade your submission for code style (these marks will remain hidden until it is graded). It may take several minutes for the grading script to complete.

Autograder.io is configured to only provide feedback on at most 5 submissions per-24-hours per-student (submissions that fail to run or receive a grade of 0 are not counted in that limit). We strongly encourage you to lint and test your submission on your local development machine, and *not* rely on Autograder.io for providing grading feedback - relying on Autograder.io is a very slow feedback loop.
To check for linter errors, run the command `npm run lint` from the terminal. The handout contains the same eslint configuration that is used by our grading script.
Submission limit resets at 11am EST.
